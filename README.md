# 11-days-of-code
### As I have completed this challenge I'm archiving this repo!
I am taking up the #11DaysOfCode Challenge from January 28, 2022. To start with, I have to code for atleast an hour every day for 11 days.
Here are the [Rules](https://github.com/Sarveshmrao/11-days-of-code/blob/main/rules.md) which I will be following for the challenge.<br>
I will be maintaining a [Log](https://github.com/Sarveshmrao/11-days-of-code/blob/main/logs.md) in this repo, so that anyone can track my progress.<br>

My main motivation behind taking up the #11DaysOfCode Challenge is to increase my consistency. As it is famously said "Consistency is the key to success." My goal is to learn to consistantly work.<br>

Feel free to give any sugestions you have for me. All suggestions are welcome.<br>
