# **11 Days of Code - Log**
## <u>Day 0 ; Dec 27st 2022 **Thursday** : </u>
Today I am taking up the #11DaysOfCode Challenge and from tomorrow I will be coding daily for atleast an hour. 📢 <br>
Today I have prepared the repo to log my progress, set up the rules I will be following, and I have made a public statement of my challenge. ✍️ <br>
I will be making my progress public to keep myself motivated to keep going. I will give my very best to complete the challenge without any obstacles. Even though the rule states only 1 Hour of code daily to be necessary for the challenge, but I will try to give atleast 2-3 hrs most of the days. 😄<br>
